# passBy
This is my first AngularJS app. It essentially lets you input a route into Google Maps, and then, it searches along that route for highly rated Google Places. Finally, your route is shown with the highly rated results, and you can asynchronously add these results to your route.

This was primarily just a proof of concept. Google Places limited me to 10 searches at a time, so the results can be hit or miss.
